      <h5 id="ab">STATE OF STATE</h5><br>
      <p class="eng">Over the last three to four weeks, Honourable PM Shri Narendra Modiji has been launching, inaugurating various infrastructural projects and educational institutions in poll-bound states. Infra drive by governments seems quite successful. However, his open unhesitant insistence on double engine government raised some questions. Are states with non-BJP governments treated step-mannerly? Recent comments by Satyapal Malik intrigued an argument: Central and state leaders are becoming more self-centric than ever before. When we got independence, provided with a constitution, we got arguably the best form of democracy built over three pillars: parliament, an independent judicial system, and allegedly independent executives. One must have expected that our political democracy has matured enough as of now, but we might say that it did reach its peak and constantly deteriorating over time.
        We can observe bitterness at its peak, extreme polarisation of society for momentary political gain, alleged purchasing of MLA's by many political parties, no-ideology alliances, contraction of democratic space to just elections. We at least expect executives to be independent, but it does not seem so. Acts of governors like blocking files, proposals from some state governments and on the opposite, allowing others to act outside their constitutional sphere is quite a lousy picture. The devotion of top bureaucracy to the ruling party over self-wisdom both at the state and central level for alleged future-proofing is a severe concern. At this stage, we cannot even think of independent thought driven MP's who, at some point in time, will oppose the position of their party based on solid personal beliefs. Authentic parliamentary practices are bypassed in this high command and whip culture. The introduction of a bill after an ordinance, without good internal discussion within neither ruling formation nor cabinet, is covered up by arguing its immediate requirement indicates disbelief in parliamentary processes. We all have seen the way bills are being passed in parliament, loosely drafted, and even a single amendment by opposition MP's is not inculcated. As per our understanding of emergency, it might not be an exaggeration that this is the second time we have seen this kind of targeted use of government agencies. We should not blame just the current government because it is in accordance with previous governments but at a higher level. 
        Overall federal structure seems to be damaged as the federal government is trying to bring uniformity to the entire country. Uniformity is not bad as long as we allow the celebration of differences. They may be in languages, religions, festivals, history, geography, food and beliefs. It is correct and high time for the federal government to give up upon centralising powers and decision-making. If they do not, this centralisation will probably increase in future governments as we usually tend to quickly imitate and worsen bad practices. Intra-party democracy should not be just mouth service. A genuinely independent election commission should monitor it to prevent parties from becoming a family-run and single-person lead. 
        How lucrative a single leader or family-run party may sound to many of us, it does not matter in the end, leading to an autocratic system. This type of arrangement does not justify regional sentiments, ultimately not good for the entire nation. Rethinking about 'whip' is required for true democracy, as we cannot or better should not hide behind walls like democracy with 'Indian Characteristics'.
        Finance of political parties requires strict watch of some independent institutions. Local bodies need to be empowered, monetarily, and more autonomy should be given as they are the nearest access points for any citizen. It will further diversify power distribution. States should get a higher cut of taxes provided that corruption is strictly at a negligible level. In today's world, data is called new oil. That's why it is the duty of government to protect the privacy of its citizens. Celebrities of all fields in any society play an important role in driving people's opinions. They should speak their heart and not the pocket. After all, democracy is a system of people, chosen and run by people, for the prosperity of people and nation. So, we, people, are at the heart of democracy. We should keep well into our mind that 'we buy a product and not the company'. Thus, we should not commit our vote to a political party on bases like caste, religion. People need not confine themselves to any party. If we choose the best representatives, the best governments are bound to form.
        All of this might sound idealistic. However, that is what our ultimate goal should be because our freedom fighters and forefathers or foremothers did not certainly spend their lives for this form of democracy/swaraj. They did expect ideal or better than our all time best. (in my opinion, around 1997 to 2008, which is relatively average in itself.)

        <h5 id="bc">Food and Health</h5><br>
        <p class="eng">Respected sir, my brothers and sisters, I am (Rutuja Mukund Kadam) very thankful to Maharashtra high school as well as headmasters union for organizing this competition, because it gives me an opportunity to express and share my views, ideas and thoughts before you on subject „Food and Health.‟
          Friends, firstly, we have clear the exact meaning of the concepts of food and health, scientifically.
          Food means any substance that people or animals eat or drink to maintain life and growth. Health is the state human being free from illness or injury. In other words, health means persons mental or physical condition so; we have to consider health in two ways that is physical health and mental health.
          There is a close relationship between food and health. Food provides the nutrients essential for the body to live and growth. However, one should eat only so much food that contributes to overall health of the body. This means that, in order to maintain our health, We have a need of balanced food. Each and every person expect healthy life.
          If our body is healthy, then we become energetic, our mental health also remain strong. There are a number of benefits of healthy physique…….. but majority of the people doesn‟t follow simple laws for health. Every part of body is of vital important, but some people are / were careless about the parts of body.
          FFoooodd aanndd HHeeaalltthh
          We are confronting a number of diseases like blood pressure, diabetis, heart attack. Now a days, horizontal exapantion of a body is becoming a common problem among peoples.
          Friends, in order to maintain our bodyin a healthy-contition ; it is important to take healthy food in our daily life. Be we are taking food exactly opposite to it. We get junkfood including pani-puri, pizza, burger and spicy items, which are harmful to our health.in brief, eating junkfood means filling our stomach with ammunation means poison. Due to it, what will happen? One day it will burst or dangerous to our body. By eating junkfood and drinking harmful baverages, no doubt, we are calling to a number of disases.
          It is interasting to note here that some people eat simply because they like to eat, they live to eat and not eat to live. Then what happen? It can affect health rather adversly.
          Another point is that if we don‟t take food on time, it will take tall our health,
          Food is for sense, Food is for our mind, Body and soul,
          If not had on time, On our health it takes a toll.
          It means that our health will be affect adversly and may even result in our death.
          On other hand, if we eat in moderelation or optimum, we shall not grew horizontly. To remain perfectly healthy one should almost continuosly remain in a state of gentle hunger. For our good physical and mental health, I am putting a good thought before you i.e. „Eat less, live longer.‟ Then our mind, body and soul will enjoy the benefits. We will experience positive emotions
          and many joys. In the long run, health will be benefited. As we earlier see that health must be considered in two ways that is physical health and mental health. So, it is genrally accepted by a large number of physicians and chemists that,
          “happy mind means healthy tonic for health, Nervous mind means poison for health.”
          So, we have to keep our mind in a ballanced state. Now by taking in cocederation organisation of this competition what we have learn and how we can implement thesein our daily lifeis of vital important. So, I am pulting quontiation before you that is, „prevention is better then cure‟ is a key for our health. Generally it is said that, „an apple a day keeps doctor away.‟
          Friends, do you know how many calories we get from different fruits? I read a book named „prevent heart-disease and prolong life‟ by gala that from 100gm apple we get 66 calories. Keep well into mind that we have to eat fruits at the time when our stomach is empty.
          Eating banana early in the morning like a gold,
          In after-noon like silver, At the night like a steel.
          Now, you are free to at whoich time have eat banana. Now you can choice your diet, mind state, food, proportion of food and health. Once again, I am very thankful to you all. Thanks. Thank you so much.

        <h5 id="cd">My Country</h5><br>
        <p class="eng">Respected sir, my brothers and sisters, I am very thankful to Maharashtra high school as well as headmasters union for organizing this competition, because it gives me an opportunity to express and share my views, ideas and thoughts before you on subject ‘My Country.’ No doubt, my country is India. India became an independent country on 15th August 1947. India has a long history of ancient and glorious traditions and rich cultural heritage. Here, a tradition means the customs or beliefs passed by one generation to next generation and culture is a way of life. Indian culture is superior throughout the world. Friends, ‘All-religion-equality-conference’ was held in Chicago, USA. In that conference, Swami Vivekananda was a representative for India. He began his speech with the words i.e. my brothers and sisters and what happened? …Due to these words, he won the conference. Any- one ask how? ... So, these two words have capability to make relationship of universal brotherhood. Another point regarding Indian culture is अतिथी देवो भव That’s why religion and hospitality are two pillars of Indian culture. In my country India, people belonging to different races, communities, religions, castes, languages and cultural groups have lived together. It denotes National Integration. So, I am proud of India.
          
          Due its vast size, many times India is also known as Indian sub-continent. It exhibits a land of social diversity but there is a unity in diversity because all people inhibited this land was and is termed as Indians. Hence, my friends, in our school we start our pledge in our school with the lines i.e. India is my country. All Indians are my brothers and sisters. I love my country, and so on. India is holy land of Prabhu Rama and Lord Shri-Krishna. Shahu, Fuel, Dr. Ambedkar had taught humanism to society. This mother land gave birth to Shivray, Mahatma Gandhi, Tilak, Bhagat sing and Sawarkar who teaches sacrifice. India is best from east to west And from north to south In other words, India is best from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Puri to Dwaraka. There is immortal Taj, the Dravidan temples of south especially those of Madurai and the world famous frescoes of Ajanta-Ellora. My country has varied topography including Himalayas, Vindhya, Satpura, Sahyadri, malaygiri as mountains, plains, coastal lowlands & islands. Holistic rivers namely Ganga, Yamuna, bramhaputra, Godavari, irrigated Indian agriculture. By taking into consideration of mountains, rivers, agriculture, animals, birds I remembered to lines of a Hindi song i.e. जहां डाल डाल पर सोने की है चिडीया करती बसेरा
          वह भारत देश है मेरा According to Max Muller, India is best destination for tourist all over the world. This fact was also given by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his book Discovery of India. Friends, keep well into mind that, The waves of sea can be separated from sea The light can be separated from sun But Kashmir never be separated from India As far as India marching in 21st century is concerned, India is no doubt heading towards mass scale computerization. Computer is playing a crucial role in overall progress. Now, my country is one of the top countries in the field of space research. As our late missile man A.P.J. Abdul Kalama said that “In 2020, India will become a super power in the world. Hence, my friends, on this occasion of today's competition, we will become a part and parcel of the Kalams dream about India & for India. Finally, in the words of sane guruji I expect, बलसागर भारत होवो विश्वात शोभूनी राहो Thank you. Thank you so much.

        <h5 id="de">Natural Calamities</h5><br>
        <p class="eng">Respected Sir and Madam, My Brothers and Sisters, I, Madhav Mukund Kadam, very thankful to headmasters union for organizing this competition, because it gives me an opportunity to express and share my views, Ideas and thoughts before you on subject entitled ‘Natural Calamities.’ Friends, I am putting this subject clearly into four segments; what is meant by natural calamities? ; Which are natural calamities? ; Reasons behind natural calamities and; How to cope with natural calamities.
          So friends, before going to the core of the subject I think I must tell you what is mean by a calamity? Calamity is an event causing great and often sudden damage. It is also termed as disaster. Whereas, natural calamity means occurrence of an event by nature dealing extensive havoc physical damage, loss of property and life. This situation is unfavorable for physical, social, environmental and human functioning. It causes human suffering and environmental degradation on massive scale. This situation is often more frightening than the capacity of the people living in the affected area to withstand it. Then which are natural calamities?
          An earthquake. It is result of sudden release of energy in earth's crust that creates seismic waves who vibrate, shake and even displace the ground. For example, recently in Sulawesi island of Indonesia an earthquake of 7.5 Richter scale experienced which created Tsunamis 
          and they collided on Palu town and smashed it into pulp in minutes, killing 1400 people.
          A landslide. For example, Malin village in Ambegaon tehsil of Pune district of Maharashtra experienced severe landslides; due to which out of 600 villagers and 60 houses, 158 villagers and 45 houses buried and disappeared.
          A flood. It is an overflow of water that submerges the land which is usually not covered by water. We all know about mega-flood recently observed in Kerla. A volcano. It is eruption of highly tempered lava. We all know Ki laud volcano. News channels had shown it as river of lava. A cyclone. Phayan harmed western cost of India severely in 2009. We kolhapurkars also experienced it. A cloud burst. Did you know? Last year Vashi village in Karveer tehsil experienced cloud burst. Maximum rainfall in minimum time. Crops in 10km radius were highly harmed.
          A drought. There is no rain since long time, great shortage of water and loss of crops. A wild-fire. Due to some reasons fire ignites in forest and it in and out. A solar flare, an asteroid shower, super storms, hailstorms, blizzards, ice storms and a limnic eruption-, all these are natural calamities.
          No doubt. We can’t stop natural calamities. But it is time to think that are we supporting to severity of natural calamities in any possible ways? Its answer is yes. Indiscriminate going on projects in the name of development and urbanization, damage to hills for electricity as well as
          tourism, deforestation of plateaus and exploitation of nature for mines are those activities increasing the severity of natural calamities. First of all we have to stop all these activities because prevention is better than cure, but this will not stop natural calamities completely. They will come. So it is most important that how to cope with natural calamities? That mean what steps should be followed by individuals, NGO’s and government also before calamity, at calamity and after calamity.
          According to UN international disaster mitigation strategy India is at 2nd place after china in case of natural calamities. They are determined by geo-climatic conditions and underlying weaknesses. For accurate forecast setting more observatories is useful measure. Govt. of India had made provisions to prepare National Disaster Management plan according to National Disaster Management act 2005 through which National Disaster Response Force i.e. NDRF. However, disaster warning time is very less in India. So we have to cope with natural calamities. Hence, I am putting blue print of natural calamities consisting 7 steps- prevent, prepare, identify, response, rescue, rehabilitate, reconstruct.
          What to prevent we have seen earlier. Prepare means everybody should be alert about natural calamities. Torch, first aid box, ladder and rope must be kept in each and every house. Then identify. Identify the calamity knocked at your door. Means if quake is coming you must identify it instead of frightening. Then response. Means at time of quake try to reach open ground as fast as possible.
          Then recover yourself from shock of natural calamities. Then govt. should rehabilitate the victims and finally reconstruct the destructed settlements.
          Despite all these measures awareness is the first condition for proper management. Relief agencies should have immediate access to the affected region. If people aren’t aware terrible destruction possess a problem in rescue operations. Proper management planning, people basic information of natural calamities’ management, honesty, effective leadership and co-ordination can lead to a successfully faced natural calamity.
          If everybody present at here has understood the meaning of natural calamity and measures to face it, I think that the intention of organizers behind including this subject in competition will be completed. Thank you for listening. Thank you so much!
